    Train knowledge and application of the quadratic formula.

    Exercise Parameters
    -------------------

    p_monic: float in [0,1], default=1/2
        Approximate probability that the coefficient of the quadratic term is
        1.
    w: triple of positive floats, default=(4, 4, 10)
        Weights for no, one and two distinct roots. The default weights are
        equal to the number of difficulty levels in each of these three cases
        (see below).
    small_ints: list of int, default: non-zero single digit integers
        Integers considered to be 'small' for use as roots or coefficients.
    big_ints: list of int, default: two digit integers
        Integers considered to be 'big' for use as roots or coefficients.
    nice_fracs: list of Fractions, default: fractions of nice integers
        Fractions considered to be 'nice' for use as roots or coefficients.

    Instance Parameters
    -------------------

    difficulty: float in [0,1], default: uniformly random
        Measure for difficulty, normed between 0 (trivial) and 1 (hard).
        The interval [0,1] is divided into equal subintervals, or 'levels'.

        Levels of difficulty for two simple roots:
             0: trivial case: double root at zero
             1: simple root at zero
             2: roots of a square
             3: double integer root
             4: small simple integer roots
             5: big simple integer roots
             6: one integer and one rational root
             7: simple rational roots
             8: quadratic formula with small integer coefficients
             9: quadratic formula with big integer coefficients
            10: quadratic formula with rational coefficients

        Levels of difficulty for a double root:
            0: trivial case: zero
            1: small integer root
            2: big integer root
            3: rational root

        Levels of difficulty for no roots:
            0: no linear term
            1: small integer coefficients
            2: big integer coefficients
            3: rational coefficients

    Remarks
    -------
    * We explicitly ask the number of roots for several reasons:
      * It can be determined independently of the discriminant.
      * If learners know there are two roots, but are unable to find them, they
        will still get more points than someone leaving all input fields empty.
      * The entered number of roots allows to distinguish between the two
        possible interpretations for empty input fields:
        * "I do not know how to compute the roots."
        * "There are no more roots."
    * Roots entered with the wrong sign get half the points.

    Caveats
    -------
    For simplicity, quadratic equations with complex coefficients are not
    modelled with this exercise.

            A *quadratic equation* is an equation in one indeterminate $x$ of
            the form

                    ax^2+bx+c&=0&
