Preamble
========

With the :py:meth:`preamble` method you can put the exercise to be solved into
context for the learner, for example by providing information on:

* motivation
* relevant theory
* solution methods
* pitfalls
* scoring used or
* unusual input syntax

It depends on the :ref:`configuration <configuration>`, whether the preamble is
prepended to an exercise or not. Therefore, any information absolutely
necessary to solve the exercise should go into the
:ref:`problem template <template>`. On the other hand, since the preamble can
easily be suppressed or changed, you should avoid putting any other context
information into the problem template.

                task to sum all natural numbers from 1 through 100, hoping to
                occupy him for a while. But he immediately came up with the
                correct answer: 5050. How long will you need?
